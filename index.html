        PUBG: Battlegrounds (previously known as PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds)
        is a 2017 battle royale game developed by PUBG Studios and published by
        Krafton. The game, which was inspired by 2000's Japanese film Battle
        Royale, is based on previous mods created by Brendan "PlayerUnknown"
        Greene for other games, and expanded into a standalone game under
        Greene's creative direction. It is the first game in the PUBG Universe
        series. The game is played from either a third-person or first-person
        perspective. In the game, up to one hundred players parachute onto an
        island where they scavenge for weapons and equipment to kill other
        players while avoiding getting killed themselves. The available safe
        area of the game's map decreases in size over time, directing surviving
        players into an ever-tightening space to force encounters. The last
        surviving player or team wins the round. It was first released for
        Windows via Steam's early access beta program in March 2017, with a full
        release in December 2017. The game was also released by Microsoft
        Studios for the Xbox One via its Xbox Game Preview program that same
        month, and officially released in September 2018. PUBG Mobile, a
        free-to-play mobile game version for Android and iOS, was released in
        2018, in addition to a port for the PlayStation 4. A version for the
        Stadia streaming platform was released in April 2020, with Xbox Series
        X/S and PlayStation 5 versions being released in November 2020. The game
        has been free-to-play for all platforms since January 12, 2022. The game
        received positive reviews from critics, who found that while the game
        had some technical flaws, it presented new types of gameplay that could
        be easily approached by players of any skill level and was highly
        replayable. The game was credited with popularizing the battle royale
        genre, with a number of unofficial Chinese clones also being produced
        following its success. The game received several Game of the Year
        nominations and set seven Guinness World Records, among many other
        accolades. PUBG Corporation has run several small tournaments and
        introduced in-game tools to help with broadcasting the game to
        spectators, as they wish for it to become a popular esport. It has sold
        over 75 million copies on personal computers and game consoles, is the
        best-selling game on PC and on Xbox One, and is the fifth best-selling
        video game of all time. Until Q3 2022, the game has accumulated $13
        billion in worldwide revenue, including from the more successful mobile
        version of the game, and it is considered to be one of the
        highest-grossing video games of all time.

      <h1 class="display 3">Gameplay</h1>
      <p>
        PUBG is a player versus player shooter game in which up to one hundred
        players fight in a battle royale, a type of large-scale last man
        standing deathmatch where players fight to remain the last alive.
        Players can choose to enter the match solo, duo, or with a small team of
        up to four people. The last person or team alive wins the match.[1] Each
        match starts with players parachuting from a plane onto one of the eight
        maps which have different sizes and terrain.[2] The plane's flight path
        across the map varies with each round, requiring players to quickly
        determine the best time to eject and parachute to the ground.[1] Players
        start with no gear beyond customized clothing selections which do not
        affect gameplay. Once they land, players can search buildings, ghost
        towns and other sites to find weapons, vehicles, armor, and other
        equipment. These items are procedurally distributed throughout the map
        at the start of a match, with certain high-risk zones typically having
        better equipment.[1] Killed players can be looted to acquire their gear
        as well.[1] Players can opt to play either from the first-person or
        third-person perspective, each having their own advantages and
        disadvantages in combat and situational awareness; though
        server-specific settings can be used to force all players into one
        perspective to eliminate some advantages.[3] Every few minutes, the
        playable area of the map begins to shrink down towards a random
        location, with any player caught outside the safe area taking damage
        incrementally, and eventually being eliminated if the safe zone is not
        entered in time; in game, the players see the boundary as a shimmering
        blue wall that contracts over time.[4] This results in a more confined
        map, in turn increasing the chances of encounters.[1] During the course
        of the match, random regions of the map are highlighted in red and
        bombed, posing a threat to players who remain in that area.[5] In both
        cases, players are warned a few minutes before these events, giving them
        time to relocate to safety.[6] A plane will fly over various parts of
        the playable map occasionally at random, or wherever a player uses a
        flare gun, and drop a loot package, containing items which are typically
        unobtainable during normal gameplay. These packages emit highly visible
        red smoke, drawing interested players near it and creating further
        confrontations.[1][7] On average, a full round takes no more than 30
        minutes.[6] At the completion of each round, players gain in-game
        currency based on their performance. The currency is used to purchase
        crates which contain cosmetic items for character or weapon
        customization.[8] A rotating "event mode" was added to the game in March
        2018. These events change up the normal game rules, such as establishing
        larger teams or squads, or altering the distribution of weapons and
        armor across the game map.

        The game's concept and design was led by Brendan Greene, better known by
        his online handle PlayerUnknown, who had previously created the ARMA 2
        mod DayZ: Battle Royale, an offshoot of popular mod DayZ, and inspired
        by the 2000 Japanese film Battle Royale.[10][11] At the time he created
        DayZ: Battle Royale, around 2013, Irish-born Greene had been living in
        Brazil for a few years as a photographer, graphic designer, and web
        designer, and played video games such as Delta Force: Black Hawk Down
        and America's Army.[12][13] The DayZ mod caught his interest, both as a
        realistic military simulation and its open-ended gameplay, and he
        started playing around with a custom server, learning programming as he
        went along.[12] Greene found most multiplayer first-person shooters too
        repetitive, considering maps small and easy to memorize. He wanted to
        create something with more random aspects so that players would not know
        what to expect, creating a high degree of replayability; this was done
        by creating vastly larger maps that could not be easily memorized, and
        using random item placement across it.[14] Greene was also inspired by
        an online competition for DayZ called Survivor GameZ, which featured a
        number of Twitch and YouTube streamers fighting until only a few were
        left; as he was not a streamer himself, Greene wanted to create a
        similar game mode that anyone could play.[14] His initial efforts on
        this mod were more inspired by The Hunger Games novels, where players
        would try to vie for stockpiles of weapons at a central location, but he
        moved away from this partially to give players a better chance at
        survival by spreading weapons around, and also to avoid copyright issues
        with the novels.[11] In taking inspiration from the Battle Royale film,
        Greene had wanted to use square safe areas, but his inexperience in
        coding led him to use circular safe areas instead, which persisted to
        Battlegrounds.[11] When DayZ became its own standalone title, interest
        in his ARMA 2 version of the Battle Royale mod trailed off, and Greene
        transitioned development of the mod to ARMA 3.[12] Sony Online
        Entertainment (now the Daybreak Game Company) had become interested in
        Greene's work, and brought him on as a consultant to develop on H1Z1,
        licensing the battle royale idea from him.[12] In February 2016, Sony
        Online split H1Z1 into two separate games, the survival mode H1Z1: Just
        Survive, and the battle royale-like H1Z1: King of the Kill, around the
        same time that Greene's consultation period was over.[15] Separately,
        the Seoul-based studio Ginno Games, led by Chang-han Kim and who
        developed massively multiplayer online games (MMOs) for personal
        computers, was acquired and renamed Bluehole Ginno Games by Bluehole in
        January 2015, a major South Korean publisher of MMOs and mobile
        games.[16][17] Kim recognized that producing a successful game in South
        Korea generally meant it would be published globally, and wanted to use
        his team to create a successful title for personal computers that
        followed the same model as other mobile games published by Bluehole. He
        had already been excited about making a type of battle royale game after
        he had played DayZ, in part that the format had not caught on in Korea.
        He also wanted to make this through an early access model and have a
        very limited development schedule to get the game out as quickly as
        possible, while treating the product as a "games as a service" model to
        be able to support it for many years.[16] In researching what had been
        done, he came across Greene's mods and reached out to him.[16] In July
        2017, Bluehole partnered with social media platform Facebook to provide
        exclusive streaming content to Facebook's gaming channels, as part of
        their push to provide more gaming content for its users.[18] Around the
        same time that Greene left Sony Online, Kim contacted and offered him
        the opportunity to work on a new battle royale concept. Within a week,
        Greene flew out to Bluehole's headquarters in Korea to discuss the
        options, and a few weeks later, he became the creative director of
        Bluehole. He moved to South Korea to oversee development.[14] According
        to Greene, this was the first time a Korean game studio had brought
        aboard a foreigner for a creative director role, and while it was a
        risk, he says that his relationship with Bluehole's management is
        strong, allowing Greene's team to work autonomously with minimal
        oversight.[6] The game's main musical theme was composed by Tom Salta,
        who was personally selected by Greene as he and the team were looking
        for an "orchestral electronic hybrid theme" that would give players a
        "huge build-up", keeping them "resolutely determined" until a match
        starts.[19] The music for 6th anniversary was composed by Antti
        Martikainen.[20] Development began in early 2016 and was publicly
        announced that June, with plans to have the game ready within a
        year.[21][22] Kim served as executive producer for the game.[14]
        Bluehole started with a team of about 35 developers supporting Greene's
        work, but had expanded to 70 by June 2017.[23] Greene stated that many
        of these developers were voluntarily putting in longer work hours into
        the game due to their dedication to the project, and not by any mandate
        from himself or Bluehole's management.[14][24] In addition to Bluehole,
        Greene also credits Bohemia Interactive, the developers of ARMA and
        DayZ, for support with motion capture animations via their Prague
        studio.[24][23] With the rapid growth of interest in the game, Bluehole
        spun out the entire development for PUBG into Bluehole Ginno Games in
        September 2017, which was renamed PUBG Corporation with Kim as its chief
        executive officer. PUBG Corporation continued the development of the
        game and its marketing and growth, opening an office in the United
        States with plans for future ones in Europe and Japan.[25] In August
        2018, PUBG Corporation launched the "Fix PUBG" campaign, acknowledging
        that the game by then still had several lingering bugs and other
        performance issues.[26] The campaign finished in November, with PUBG
        Corporation calling it a success as everything listed had been
        implemented by then.[27] In March 2019, Greene announced that he was
        stepping down as the game's lead designer, but would still serve as a
        creative consultant. Tae-seok Jang, the game's art director, would
        replace him, with Green relocating to PUBG's studio in Amsterdam, PUBG
        Special Projects.[28] Greene stated that he believed the main PUBG team
        was at a place to continue developing the game in the direction he had
        set to keep the game unique among the other battle royale games it had
        launched, and he wanted to try something not tied to battle royale but
        still multiplayer-based. The move also put him closer to his family in
        Ireland.[29] With the success of PUBG, Bluehole created Krafton as a
        holding company for its video game assets and studios in 2018, taking
        over the publishing duties for PUBG and related games.[30][31] By
        December 2020, Krafton merged PUBG Corporation into their internal
        studio system, rebranding the team as PUBG Studios.[32]

      <h2><mark>Mobile Versions</mark></h2>
      <p>
        Following the Chinese publication deal for the Windows version, Tencent
        Games and PUBG Corporation additionally announced that they were
        planning on releasing two mobile versions based on the game in the
        country.[96][97] The first, PUBG: Exhilarating Battlefield, is an
        abridged version of the original game, and was developed by LightSpeed &
        Quantum Studio, an internal division of Tencent Games.[98] The second,
        PUBG: Army Attack, includes more arcade-style elements, including action
        taking place on warships, and was developed by Tencent's TiMi
        Studio.[99] Both versions are free-to-play, and were released for
        Android and iOS devices on February 9, 2018.[100][101] The games had a
        combined total of 75 million pre-registrations, and ranked first and
        second on the Chinese iOS download charts at launch.[101] Following a
        soft launch in Canada, an English version of Exhilarating Battlefield,
        localized simply as PUBG Mobile, was released worldwide on March 19,
        2018.[102][103][104] Following its release, a Korean and Japanese
        oriented version of the game released in June 2018, under the title name
        PUBG Mobile KR. A Vietnamese version, PUBG Mobile VN released in January
        2019. In China, PUBG Mobile had been awaiting approval by the government
        for an authorized release, during which the game could only be offered
        as a public test. However, Tencent's planned release was suspended due
        to the government approval freeze across most of 2018. By May 2019,
        Tencent announced it would no longer seek to publish PUBG Mobile in
        China, but instead would re-release the game under the title Game for
        Peace that readily meets China's content restrictions, such as
        eliminating blood and gore.[105] Taiwanese version of the game was
        released following the Chinese version, as PUBG Mobile TW. A version
        meant for lower-end mobile devices which features a smaller map made for
        60 players, PUBG Mobile Lite, was released on July 25, 2019.[106][107]
        This had support for high FPS gameplay on multiple Android devices.[108]
        The Chinese version of the app was again renamed to Peacekeeper Elite in
        2020.[109] Support for 90 FPS gameplay was added for selected OnePlus
        devices in August 2020.[108][110] On May 6, 2021, Krafton announced the
        relaunch of the game in India, following the ban imposed by the
        Government of India. Krafton directly published the game instead of
        Tencent as a newly named title which could only be accessed by users in
        India as Battlegrounds Mobile India.

      <h1><code>Other games and media</code></h1>

        Krafton had looked to expand PUBG beyond the core game as to expand the
        narrative universe. As part of this, PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds was
        quietly rebranded as PUBG: Battlegrounds around July 2021.[120] Starting
        in 2020, Krafton released a series of live-action documentaries starring
        Jonathan Frakes that explored the origins of the game's Battlegrounds.
        Ahead of the game's Taego expansion in July 2021, Krafton released
        another live-action short called "Ground Zero", featuring Ma Dong-seok
        (aka Don Lee).[121] Krafton announced a partnership with Adi Shankar in
        July 2021 to develop an animated series based on the PUBG universe.[122]
        In 2019, Krafton created a new studio Striking Distance, helmed by Glen
        Schofield, who previously led development on the Dead Space series. In
        2020, Schofield revealed that the studio was working on The Callisto
        Protocol, a game set in the PUBG universe but in the far future, taking
        place on a prison colony established on Jupiter's moon Callisto.[123]
        Krafton announced a new game in development named PUBG: New State. This
        particular game is separated from PUBG: Battlegrounds but taking place
        in the PUBG Universe. Pre-registrations were opened for the game on
        February 25, 2021.[124] It was released on 11 November that year for iOS
        and Android.[125] The game takes place in the year 2051 and is based on
        future warfare.[126] On January 27, 2022, the title name changed from
        "PUBG: New State" to "New State Mobile".[127]
